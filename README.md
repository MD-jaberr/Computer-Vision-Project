The aim of this project is to:
-	Augment images and save them with their labels to increase the number of data
-	Train a YOLOv5 model on training data and test the model
-	Tune the hyperparameters, train and test again
-	Inspect the performance of each train and test on Tensorboard
-	Evaluate the performance of the models
-	Export the model to ONNX
-	Use Netron to visualize the model
-	Create an inference API showing the bounding box x_center, y_center, width, height, class name, and confidence scores in JSON files
